#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-image-gen.sh - one hard-bounded image generation call to the Gemini API
# (Nano Banana family), for fleet creatives and illustration work.
#
# Why it exists rather than an agent calling curl itself: every call SPENDS THE
# CAPTAIN'S MONEY, and the four models differ in price by roughly 4x. A tool
# whose model is pinned, whose spend is logged, and whose credential can never
# reach a process list is the only shape that is safe to hand to an unattended
# worker. The safety envelope is enforced here deterministically:
#   - the API key is passed through a curl config on STDIN, never in argv and
#     never in the URL, so it cannot appear in `ps`, a shell history, or a log;
#   - the prompt is read from a file or stdin and reaches the request body only
#     through `jq --rawfile`, so quotes, `$`, backticks, and newlines in creative
#     text are data and can never become shell or JSON syntax;
#   - a hard positive timeout bounds the call, so a hung API cannot wedge a task;
#   - the model is verified against the API's own live catalogue before spending
#     anything, and an unavailable model FAILS LOUDLY rather than falling back.
#
# That last rule is paid for. `agy` silently downgraded any unrecognized model
# slug to its cheapest tier and warned only in the TUI, never headless, so a
# whole day of design work ran on the wrong model without a single visible sign.
# A generation tool that quietly substitutes a model is the same defect wearing
# a different name: here, a model this API does not list is an error.
#
# Output: the absolute path of each written image on stdout, one per line, plus
# one `cost=` line on stderr. The API key is never printed on either stream.
#
# Exit status: 0 on a written image, 2 on a usage error, 3 when the credential
# is missing or rejected, 4 when the model is unavailable, 5 on a timeout, 6
# when the API returned no image, 7 when the daily spend cap would be crossed,
# 8 when the API refused for quota or balance reasons (a fine key, an empty
# prepayment balance - the two are not the same failure and must not share a code).
#
# Usage:
#   fm-image-gen.sh --prompt-file <path> [--out <dir>] [--model <id>]
#   fm-image-gen.sh --prompt - [--out <dir>]        # prompt on stdin
#   fm-image-gen.sh --check-models                  # live catalogue, spends nothing
#
# Environment:
#   GEMINI_IMAGE_API_KEY   the credential. Read from the environment first, then
#                          from $FM_HOME/.env, which is captain-private and
#                          gitignored (AGENTS.md section "This repo is a shared
#                          template"). Never committed, never echoed.
#   FM_IMAGE_GEN_TIMEOUT   hard bound in seconds; positive integer, default 120.
#                          Image generation is slow; this is not the 20s a CLI
#                          probe uses.
#
# Daily cap: Google Cloud has no hard spending stop - a billing budget only
# SENDS AN ALERT and the spend continues past it. The only real brake on a
# runaway agent loop is local and before the call, so this tool keeps its own
# per-day ledger in state/image-gen-spend.tsv and refuses past
# config/image-daily-usd-cap (default $5/day) with exit 7.
#
# The cap is in DOLLARS rather than images because an image count silently
# changes meaning when the model changes: 200 images is ~$13 on flash and ~$48
# on pro at 4K. Prices used for the cap are deliberately conservative - the top
# of a model's range, and the dearest known rate for a model not in the table -
# so the cap errs toward underspending. Only images actually written are
# charged, so a refused or failed call never consumes budget.

fm-image-gen.sh - one hard-bounded image generation call to the Gemini API
(Nano Banana family). Every call spends money; there is no free tier for any
image model.

Usage:
  fm-image-gen.sh --prompt-file <path> [--out <dir>] [--model <id>]
  fm-image-gen.sh --prompt - [--out <dir>] [--model <id>]
  fm-image-gen.sh --check-models

Options:
  --prompt-file <path>  read the prompt from a file
  --prompt -            read the prompt from stdin
  --out <dir>           where to write the image (default: the current directory)
  --model <id>          override config/image-model for this call only
  --check-models        print the API's live image-model catalogue and exit;
                        spends nothing

The model comes from config/image-model, defaulting to gemini-3.1-flash-image
(Nano Banana 2). A model this API does not list is an ERROR, never a silent
downgrade to a cheaper one.

Exit status: 0 wrote an image, 2 usage, 3 credential, 4 model unavailable,
5 timeout, 6 no image in the response, 7 daily spend cap reached, 8 API quota
or prepayment balance exhausted (the key is fine - do not regenerate it).

The daily cap (config/image-daily-usd-cap, default $5/day) is counted in DOLLARS
and checked BEFORE the billable call. Google Cloud budgets only alert and never
stop spend, so this local brake is the one that actually holds.
