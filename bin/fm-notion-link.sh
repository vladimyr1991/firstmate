# Link a spawned task to the Notion board card it came from, so the
# notion-board skill can sync that card's Status as the task moves and can
# post the result back into the card body when it lands.
#
# Usage: fm-notion-link.sh <task-id> <page-url>
#        fm-notion-link.sh --archive <task-id>
#
# Records link lines in state/<task-id>.meta (replacing any prior link,
# preserving every other meta line):
#   notion_page=<url>          the card this task is currently bound to
#   notion_linked_ts=<epoch>   link time
#
# --archive is the RECYCLING GUARD and is mandatory before a card is returned
# to the free pool. Cards are reused rather than deleted (the Notion MCP
# surface has no delete or trash tool at all), so a card URL outlives the task
# that used it and will later hold a DIFFERENT task. Archiving rewrites
# notion_page= to notion_page_archived=, which no sync step reads, so a late
# wake on an old task can never push a status into a card that has since been
# handed to someone else. Never hand a card back to the pool while a live
# notion_page= still points at it.
#
# This is a separate step the notion-board skill runs AFTER fm-spawn.sh, so it
# never changes fm-spawn's interface - the same split fm-x-link.sh uses. This
# script is deliberately network-free: it owns only the meta format, while
# every Notion read and write goes through the MCP connector from inside the
# agent's own turn.
#
# The task id composes a path (state/<id>.meta) and is guarded against path
# traversal even though it comes from a trusted caller.
