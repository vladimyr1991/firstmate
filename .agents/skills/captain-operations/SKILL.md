# captain-operations

Distilled from working sessions with this captain. Where it repeats a rule that
already exists, it says where the rule lives rather than restating it as new.

## The goal

Firstmate exists so the captain states **what** they want and gets a finished,
verified result — without holding the *how* in their head. Everything below
serves that, and any rule that stops serving it should be raised, not obeyed
silently.

Three habits this captain has paid for and expects:

**Measure, do not assume.** Listings and status commands lie. `agy` reported a
model it was not using; `ruff` had far wider defaults than documented;
`codex login status` reported success on a spent token; `quota-axi` showed
`auth_required` for a provider that answered fine in JSON; a metadata probe said
"API keys are not supported" on an endpoint that then generated an image. **Probe
the call you actually need, never its neighbour.**

**Own the miss plainly.** Say what broke, what it cost, and what changed so it
cannot recur. No hedging, no burying it under what went well.

**Finish the chain.** A green unit test on one link says nothing about the
others. Before calling anything done, name every link out loud — trigger,
caller, dispatcher, performer — and check each one exists.

## Session start

**Arm the watcher. Every session, first thing.**

Without it there is no supervision: no `state/*.check.sh` sweep, no wake queue,
no stuck-task detection, and the scheduled sprint-board check never fires. A
fleet with a dead watcher looks healthy and is blind — on 2026-08-06 the beacon
sat an hour cold while tasks were in flight and nobody noticed.

Arm through `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`, and **only** as the harness's own tracked
background task (for a Claude primary, the Stop asyncRewake hook
`bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh`). Never with a shell `&` inside another call:
that child is reaped when the call returns, leaving no watcher running and a
false "already running" off the dying process. That exact mistake took
supervision down for about thirty minutes.

Then verify rather than assume: `state/.last-watcher-beat` must be fresh within
`FM_GUARD_GRACE`. "I ran the arm command" is not evidence; a fresh beacon is.

## Delivery flow

`CONTRIBUTING.md` already mandates this. It is repeated here because it was
violated for a whole day before anyone noticed.

1. **Never work on `main`.** Branch first: `fm/<slug>-r1`.
2. **Work in a worktree**, not by switching branches in the main clone. The
   clone stays on `main`, which is where agents read their scripts from — moving
   it out from under them removes their tools mid-flight.
3. **Commit in meaningful pieces**, not one dump. Each message says what broke
   and why the change is shaped that way, not what the diff shows.
4. **Never merge without the captain's explicit word** (hard rule 2).
5. `gh` defaults to the wrong repository here — the upstream, not this fork.
   **Always pass `--repo vladimyr1991/firstmate`**, or PR creation fails with a
   confusing "no commits between".
6. After merge, **fast-forward the main clone** (`git merge --ff-only
   origin/main`). Skip it and the work is in GitHub but absent from the fleet.
7. Tag releases: `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `v<x.y.z>`.
8. Changing shared tracked material **while a crewmate is live** is forbidden —
   delegate it or wait for an empty fleet (`AGENTS.md` section 1).

Version bumps: MAJOR only for **contract** breaks a running fleet would notice
(meta format, config names, exit codes). MINOR adds capability, PATCH fixes.

## Configuration map

Everything below is LOCAL and gitignored. `config/*.backup` files are firstmate's
own snapshots, not settings — ignore them when reading state.

| Setting | Now | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `config/backend` | `herdr` | Session backend. **Authoritative**: `fm-spawn.sh` refuses a `--backend` naming anything else. If it is unusable, report and stop — never spawn elsewhere. |
| `config/crew-harness` | `claude` | Default harness for crewmates. |
| `config/secondmate-harness` | `claude` | Harness the primary uses to launch secondmates. |
| `config/crew-dispatch.json` | rules | Per-role harness/model/effort. **The one place a vendor belongs** — rules elsewhere name roles. |
| `config/image-model` | `gemini-3.1-flash-image` | Image model. Verified live before use; unavailable = loud failure, never substitution. |
| `config/image-daily-usd-cap` | `5` | Image spend per UTC day, in **dollars**, enforced before the billable call. |
| `config/sprint-poll.env` | `3600`, `9-20`, `1-5` | Scheduled sprint-board check. Absent = hard no-op. |
| `config/startup-memory-budget` | `7500` | Startup memory budget in tokens. |
| `.env` | `GEMINI_IMAGE_API_KEY` | The image credential — a Vertex **express** key (`AQ.`). |

Two traps in that table, both paid for:

**The image key must be an express key.** A standard `AIz` Gemini API key is
refused by Vertex and falls back to AI Studio prepayment, which is empty — so it
fails on *every* call, even free-tier text. `--check-models` cannot work with an
express key at all: catalogue reads answer `API_KEY_SERVICE_BLOCKED` while
generation works fine. **That message never means the key is dead.**

**The daily cap counts money, not images.** 200 images is ~$13 on flash and ~$48
on pro at 4K. An agent that hits the cap reports and stops; raising it is the
captain's decision, and an agent editing its own limit has no limit.

## Tools worth knowing

- `bin/fm-quota-dash.sh` — live gauges for the dispatch-driving windows only
  (Claude, Codex, Grok) plus image spend; Grok's separate weekly cap is
  unmeasured and flagged rather than scored. The script header owns the rest.
- `bin/fm-image-gen.sh` — creative generation; `--size` defaults to 1K because
  pro returns 4K unasked and triples the price.
- `bin/fm-version.sh`, `bin/fm-sprint-poll.sh`, `bin/fm-crew-state.sh`.
- Watch a worker with `bin/fm-peek.sh`, never `tmux attach -r`: a read-only
  client blocks **every** `send-keys` on that server, not just the pane viewed.
