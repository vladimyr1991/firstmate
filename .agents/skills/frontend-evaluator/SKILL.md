# frontend-evaluator

This skill owns the browser evaluation gate: who evaluates frontend work, how they drive the running app, what counts as a blocking defect, and how findings travel back to the worker that wrote the code.

It exists because a DOM assertion suite and an agent's own judgement both miss the same class of defect: an element that renders correctly, passes every selector check, and does nothing when a user clicks it. That is not hypothetical here - a landing redesign shipped to the test stand with most of its new buttons inert while `make test` was green.

## The generator never evaluates itself

An agent asked to judge work it produced praises it.
The generator is the crewmate that wrote the code; the evaluator is a **separate spawn with its own context** that did not write it.
Never ask the generator to confirm its own UI works, and never accept "I verified it visually" from the agent that built it as evidence.
Independence comes from two places, and the second was added deliberately: the evaluator has its own context, **and it runs on a different vendor**. Whatever vendor the generator runs on, the evaluator must run on a different one. A critic that shares the builder's model shares its blind spots and its taste, so a separate vendor buys a genuinely different read of the same page rather than a second opinion from the same mind.

Which vendor that is comes from the dispatch profile, never from this file: `config/crew-dispatch.json` names the concrete harness and model for each role, and `quota-array-dispatch` picks between candidates on remaining headroom. Naming a vendor here would freeze today's fleet into a rule that outlives it - the requirement is *different from the generator's*, not *this particular brand*.

Three traps, all paid for on 2026-08-05:

- **Entitlement moves.** `gpt-5.6-sol` returned `400 ... not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account` and then answered normally under an hour later, as the subscription settled. A model that failed once is not permanently unavailable, and a model that worked once may stop. Verify with a real call at the moment it matters.
- **Slugs carry the `gpt-5.6-` prefix.** Bare `gpt-5.6` is rejected with a 400 even though documentation lists it alongside `gpt-5.6-sol` as the flagship.
- **`codex login status` and `codex doctor` both report success on a spent token.** They read the stored auth mode, not liveness; only a real request surfaces `refresh token was already used`. When every model fails identically, suspect auth rather than the slug, and fix it with `codex logout && codex login`.

The evaluator reads and drives. It never edits code, never commits, and never lands anything.
A `pass` verdict is permission to continue through the project's normal gates, never a substitute for any of them.

## Preconditions

The generator's work must be **committed** to its `fm/<id>` branch before it signals the gate. Uncommitted work is invisible to the evaluator, and evaluating stale code is worse than not evaluating at all.
The project's own test gate must already be green: the evaluator judges what actually built and passed, not a work in progress.

## Worktrees: separate, always

The evaluator takes **its own worktree** and checks out the generator's branch there:

```sh
git checkout fm/<task-id>
```

No push and no remote are involved - worktrees of one clone share git refs, so a local commit in the generator's worktree is immediately visible from the evaluator's.

**Never run the evaluator in the generator's worktree**, however tempting it looks given that the evaluator writes nothing. The danger is not writing, it is teardown: `fm-teardown.sh` acts on the `worktree=` path recorded in `state/<id>.meta`, and nothing anywhere checks whether two tasks recorded the same path. Tearing down the evaluator would, inside the generator's live worktree, detach HEAD and `git branch -D` the generator's branch, delete its hook files, then `treehouse return --force` - which terminates the running agent and hard-resets the directory, discarding uncommitted work.

The safety check does not save you, and is worst for exactly this shape: `validate_worktree_teardown_safety` returns immediately for `kind=scout`, because a scout's worktree is declared scratch. A scout-shaped evaluator sails straight into the destructive path. A ship-shaped one instead can never be torn down cleanly, because the dirty check sees the generator's work and refuses.

Two related facts, recorded so they are not rediscovered:

- Ordinary task worktrees hold **no lease** - only dirtiness keeps `treehouse get` from handing one out again. A generator that commits everything and goes clean is, in principle, re-gettable.
- `treehouse enter --print-path` is the primitive for attaching to an in-use worktree, and `treehouse return` has unused `--if-lease-holder` / `--if-lease-id` guards. If shared access is ever genuinely needed, those are the anchors - and `fm-teardown.sh` must be taught ownership in the same change, never before it.

## Standing the app up

Run the app on a **free lane**, never on the default dev ports, so a concurrent test run or the captain's own dev stack is untouched.
The project owns the lane math; in `parlino` it is `frontend/e2e/fixtures/ports.mjs` (`E2E_LANE=<0..99>`, stride 10, so lane 1 is frontend 5209 / backend 8209 / worker-stub 8208), and it already exports `busyPorts()` for picking a free one.

**Never free a port by killing whatever holds it.** A busy port is somebody else's test run or dev stand. Pick another lane. This prohibition is already stated in the project `Makefile`, its `AGENTS.md`, and its port preflight; it is repeated here because the evaluator is the most likely agent to meet a busy port.

Shut the stand down when the evaluation ends, including on failure.

**Which build you evaluate is part of the verdict.**
Default to the project's dev server, because that is what its own test gate runs, and say so in the report.
Build and serve the production bundle instead when the task's deliverable is one of these:

- animation, transition, or anything else whose correctness is a matter of timing or frames;
- bundle size, load behavior, or anything that a bundler transform could change;
- a defect reported from the deployed stand rather than found locally;
- an explicit instruction in the brief to evaluate the shipped artifact.

In `parlino` that is `npm run build && npm run preview -- --port <free lane port>` from `frontend/`, on the same lane math and under the same never-kill-a-port rule as above.
This costs a full production build plus a second server on every round, which is exactly why it is conditional rather than standing: a rule that makes every evaluation expensive gets worked around, and a worked-around rule protects nothing.

Every evaluation this fleet has run to date used a vite dev server on a desktop Mac under CDP emulation.
Nothing has ever exercised a production bundle and nothing has ever run on a real phone.
That is not a defect in any one evaluation.
It becomes one the moment a `pass` is read as coverage nobody had, which is what the environment line in the findings file exists to prevent.

## Driving the browser

Use `chrome-devtools-axi`, a CLI, so this works from any harness with no MCP account binding.
Isolate every evaluator with its own session: `CHROME_DEVTOOLS_AXI_SESSION=eval-<task-id>`, so parallel evaluations never share a browser.
Consult `chrome-devtools-axi --help` for current commands rather than trusting remembered flags.

The loop, per surface under test:

1. `open <url>` the page the task touched.
2. `snapshot` to get the interactive elements and their uids - this is what makes the pass adaptive rather than a fixed script.
3. For **every element the task added or changed**: `click` / `fill` / `press` it and observe what actually happened. A button that produces no navigation, no request, and no state change is a defect regardless of how it looks.
4. `console` and `network` after the interactions - a clean-looking page throwing a `TypeError` on click, or firing a request that 404s, fails.
5. `screenshot` the surface at desktop width, then take the mobile viewport with `emulate --viewport "375x812x3,mobile,touch"` and screenshot again.

**Verify the viewport you got, never the one you asked for.**
Read it back before the mobile screenshot and put the number in your report:

```sh
chrome-devtools-axi eval "() => { return JSON.stringify({iw: innerWidth, dpr: devicePixelRatio}) }"
```

Two ways this lies, both measured on 2026-08-19:

- `resize 375 812` prints `width: 375` and the page then reports `innerWidth: 500`.
  macOS enforces a minimum window width, so `resize` cannot reach a phone width at all on a Mac and reports success anyway.
  Two round-trips were spent on that before anyone printed `innerWidth`.
  `emulate --viewport` sets CDP metrics rather than the OS window, which is why it works where `resize` does not.
- `emulate --viewport "375x812x3,mobile"` reports `innerWidth: 981` on a page with no `<meta name="viewport">`, because mobile mode falls back to the 980px layout viewport.
  That one is a real finding about the page rather than a tool failure, but it is still not the viewport you asked for, so the read-back catches it either way.

A mobile finding measured at a width you did not confirm is not a finding.

Switching the emulated viewport reloads the page, so start each surface's pass with the `emulate` call for the viewport that pass needs and build any state the screenshot must show afterwards, because a modal opened before the switch is gone after it.
An `emulate` call replaces the entire emulation state rather than merging into it, so every option you still want must be repeated on every call.

Study the screenshots before writing a verdict. The point of this gate is that someone looks at the page; producing a verdict without having looked reproduces exactly the failure it exists to prevent.

## Criteria

This table is the owner of what blocks. A finding in any row is blocking.

| Criterion | Blocking failure |
|---|---|
| Functionality | An element does not do what it promises: a click with no effect, a form that does not submit, a control that changes nothing, a link to nowhere. |
| Transition | Where the task's deliverable includes a transition, an animation, or motion: the change arrives instantly, or with no observable intermediate state. |
| Console and network | Any console error, or any failed request, during an ordinary user path. |
| Mobile | Horizontal scroll, overlap, clipped text, or an unreachable control at 375px. |
| Design system | A new colour, shadow, or button style invented where the project already has a token or class for it; a broken CTA hierarchy. |

The design-system row is judged against the project's own documented invariants, not against taste - read the project's `AGENTS.md` before scoring it.
In `parlino` those are concrete and checkable: exactly one `.btn-accent` on the page, `.btn-lime` reserved for the demo call, `--text-graphite` and `--shadow-float` tokens, the bento grid tiling 4x3 with no holes, glass panels over the gradient rather than flat white, page height constant at rest, one shared `LandingModal`, illustrations as inline SVG in the page palette.

The transition row is separate from functionality because every other row grades a destination.
A control is scored for what it does, never for how it gets there, so a task whose whole deliverable is a transition can pass a gate that never sampled one.
That is measured rather than feared: injecting `duration={0}` into the component under test - removing the animation outright - left 29 `parlino` tests green across desktop and mobile on 2026-08-19, and the evaluation passed too.

Sample the transition rather than watching it.
Trigger the change, read the animating value two or three times inside the tween window - roughly 150-250ms into a 600ms tween - and require at least one reading strictly between the start and the end value.
Take those samples in a single scripted session through the CLI's `run` subcommand, with the click, the wait, and the read in one script, because each separate invocation is its own process and cannot reliably land inside a 150-250ms window.
A screenshot cannot evidence a transition, because a screenshot is a destination by construction, and "it looked smooth" is not a finding for the same reason "some buttons seem broken" is not.
Where a project uses `prefers-reduced-motion` as its test seam, its interaction tests run with motion switched off, and this gate is then the only place the ordinary-motion path is observed at all.

Report anything that is merely an opinion separately and mark it non-blocking. The gate is for defects, not preferences.

## Findings

Write `data/<task-id>/evaluation-<round>.md` - `<task-id>` being the id of the task you are running as, which for a round dispatched under the `eval-<origin-task-id>-r<N>` contract below is that round's own id and never the origin task's, so a round writes into exactly one directory and never two - and keep it specific enough to act on without re-deriving anything:

- The verdict: `pass` or `fail`.
- The environment: which build you drove, the host OS, the viewport you read back rather than the one you requested, and any CPU or network throttling applied.
- What that environment could not establish.
  Name the ones that apply from this list: real-device rendering and touch, the production bundle when you drove the dev server, GPU-poor or CPU-slow hardware, and any OS accessibility setting a real user may have on.
  `prefers-reduced-motion` is the one that has already cost this fleet a landed complaint: the browser `chrome-devtools-axi` launches reports `no-preference` (measured 2026-08-19) and `emulate` has no flag to change it, so you always see the ordinary-motion path and never the reduce path a user may be on.
- One entry per finding: what was interacted with, what was expected, what actually happened, which criterion it violates, and the screenshot path.
- Absolute paths to every screenshot taken.
- Non-blocking observations in their own clearly marked section.

"Some buttons seem broken" is not a finding. "Clicked `Запустить пилот` in the pricing card (uid 42): expected the pilot form to open, nothing happened, no console output, no request; screenshot at /abs/path.png" is.

The file is the handoff. Close with a status line pointing at it so the parent is woken.

## The loop

Evaluate -> relay findings to the generator -> generator fixes, re-runs `/simplify` and the test gate -> evaluate again.

Dispatch each round as its own task named `eval-<origin-task-id>-r<N>`, N starting at 1, so its report lands at `data/eval-<origin-task-id>-r<N>/report.md`.
That naming is a contract rather than a habit: `bin/fm-retro.sh` counts a task's evaluation rounds by matching it, and a round dispatched under any other id is counted as none.

**Three rounds maximum.** If the verdict is still `fail` after the third, stop and report to the captain with what remains and why it did not converge, per `AGENTS.md` section 9. Do not keep spawning rounds; a defect that survives three targeted attempts needs a human decision, not a fourth attempt.

A `fail` verdict blocks landing. Work does not merge onward while an unresolved blocking finding stands.
